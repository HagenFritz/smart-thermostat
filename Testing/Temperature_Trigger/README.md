# Documentation, Usage, and Code for a Temperature-Changed Triggered Event
This document outlines how to create a temperature-triggered event where, when the temperature changes above or below a certain limit, an LED corresponding to hot or cold is turned on and a micro-servo motor rotates to -90 or 90, respecitvely. The temperature will be measured by the SHT31-D Temperature and Relative Humidity sensor.
