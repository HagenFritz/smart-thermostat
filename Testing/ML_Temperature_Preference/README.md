# Learning Temperature Preference with Machine Learning
This document outlines how to setup an experiment to learn the temperature preferences of a single individual. 

## Hardware Setup
For this experiment, we will need:
- 3 LEDS (preferably red, blue, and white)
- 3 resistors (anywhere between 100 and 330 Ohms will do)
- 3 push buttons
- 3 field effect transistors
- 1 temperature sensors (in this case, an SHT31-D)
- Enough wires to hook everything up (M-F and M-M only - no F-F needed)
